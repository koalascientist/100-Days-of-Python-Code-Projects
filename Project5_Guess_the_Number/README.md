# Guess the Number Game

## Description

The aim of this game is to guess the number that the computer thought about between 1 and 100. There are either 10 or 5 attempts to guess the number in dependence of the difficulty level (i.e. easy vs. hard) of the game chosen by the player. 

## Logic of the game

In the beginning of the game, the player will be asked to choose the difficulty level. Once the difficulty level is chosen, the player needs to make a guess of what the number can be. The computer then indicates if the guess is too high or too low relative to the correct answer. 

The player wins when he/she guesses the correct number and does not run out of the total number of attempts given at the beginning of the game.
